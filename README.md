# Keyword Blocker

**Keyword Blocker** is a Chrome extension that automatically closes websites whose URLs contain one or more keywords you have blocked. It provides a simple, effective way to limit access to distracting, harmful, or unwanted content.

## Features

- Instantly closes tabs that contain blocked keywords in the URL
- Simple popup UI for entering new keywords
- Keywords persist across sessions
- One-way blocking: keywords cannot be removed once added
- Designed to discourage circumvention

## How It Works

Once installed, clicking the extension icon opens a popup:
- Enter a keyword into the textbox
- Press **Enter** or click the **Add** button
- All open tabs containing that keyword will be immediately closed
- Any new tabs opened with that keyword will auto-close

> **Note:** There is no way to remove a keyword once itâ€™s added. This is an intentional design choice to reinforce commitment to self-blocking.
